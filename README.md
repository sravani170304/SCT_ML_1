# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project was developed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
It implements a **Machine Learning** model using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on the following features:

- 📏 Square Footage (`area`)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
- 🚿 Number of Bathrooms

## 🔍 Objective

To predict house prices by training a regression model using simple and interpretable features. This helps in understanding the relationship between a house’s characteristics and its market price.
