This project is built as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
It uses a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on:

- 📏 Square Footage (`area`)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
- 🚿 Number of Bathrooms
## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training with `scikit-learn`
- Evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
- Visualization: Actual vs Predicted House Prices
## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
